<p>I love cosmic horror as a genre, but like other folks on this subreddit I’ve come to dislike CoC-style Sanity mechanics. IMO at best they break the mood with cartoon antics (the PC temporarily thinks they’re a chicken or something); more often they play off harmful stereotypes of mental illness. I really like the way <em>Fate of Cthulhu</em> replaced this with a Corruption mechanic, representing the temptations of unnatural power and the way the unnatural gradually transforms a protagonist’s personality: “It’s not a form of ‘damage’ that makes a character less viable or less of a protagonist. (It’s more of a resource that, when spent by the player, pushes the character towards transformation ….)”</p>
<h1 id="connecting-with-the-unnatural-replaces-use-magic">Connecting with the Unnatural (replaces Use Magic)</h1>
<p><em>Weird</em> represents the strength of your connection to the unnatural. This connection can take many different forms: studying esoteric books, innate psychic abilities, a spirit guide, fringe scientific research, (former?) cult membership, etc. If you’re playing a character with high Weird bonus, take a moment to think about what their connection to the unnatural is like.</p>
<p>Use Magic is not available. The following basic moves take its place.</p>
<h2 id="spout-mythos">Spout Mythos</h2>
<p>You can also draw on your knowledge and understanding of the unnatural to Investigate a Mystery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll +Weird instead of +Sharp; otherwise this is identical to Investigate a Mystery.</li>
<li>Compared to the Sharp-based Investigate a Mystery, this move will tend to be more insightful, precise, or immediately useful concerning the unnatural aspects of the mystery.</li>
<li>The Sharp-based move will tend to be more insightful, accurate, or immediately useful concerning the mundane aspects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exploit-the-unnatural">Exploit the Unnatural</h2>
<p>When you draw on your connection to the unnatural to achieve an effect beyond ordinary human abilities, say what you’re trying to achieve and how, and roll +Weird. After resolving the effects of exploiting the unnatural, immediately Suffer Backlash.</p>
<ul>
<li>The effects, glitches, requirements, success, partial success, and miss conditions are identical to Use Magic.</li>
<li>One additional potential glitch is taking -1 forward to the Suffer Backlash roll.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="suffer-backlash">Suffer Backlash</h2>
<p>Exploiting your connection to the unnatural is physically and psychologically disturbing. Roll +Weird. <strong>You want to roll low.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weird is effectively a penalty, not a bonus. The stronger your connection to the unnatural, the more susceptible you are to the backlash.</li>
<li>A Hex’s Rotes (and related moves, as with the Corruption benefit) and A Spooky’s Big Whammy do not cause you to Suffer Backlash.</li>
<li>On a 10+, choose 3 from the list of Backlash Effects.</li>
<li>On a 7-9, choose 2.</li>
<li>On a miss, choose 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="backlash-effects">Backlash Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>-1 ongoing for all non-Weird rolls*</li>
<li>-Weird forward</li>
<li>You experience a personality shift (unusually aggressive, passive, fearful, short-sighted, etc.)*</li>
<li>Check 1 Corruption</li>
<li>Take 1 Harm</li>
</ul>
<p>*: These effects are temporary, and are removed either by taking a short break from the action in relative peace and quiet <em>or</em> you or another character successfully Acts Under Pressure to talk you down.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-exploit-the-unnatural">Advanced Exploit the Unnatural</h2>
<p>All playbooks have the following advanced improvement available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Exploit the Unnatural</strong>: When exploiting the unnatural, on a 12+ you do not Suffer Backlash.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="corruption">Corruption</h2>
<p>Every character has 7 Corruption boxes, which start empty. When you check the last box do all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanently take +1 Weird and -1 any other attribute
<ul>
<li>If your character has +4 Weird, their days as a PC are numbered. Talk to the Keeper about how the character’s story will transition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gain 1 rote (as per the Hex playbook)</li>
<li>Undergo a permanent personality shift making you less reliable and trustworthy as a teammate, eg, more suspicious, secretive, unpredictable, more likely to act rashly, ignore advice and assistance from others, willing to sacrifice others for your own benefit, etc.
<ul>
<li>Explain to the Keeper what the personality shift will look like, so they can encourage you to roleplay that shift.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Empty all 7 Corruption boxes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clearing-corruption">Clearing corruption</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to clear Corruption boxes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For each session where your character is active but does not Exploit the Unnatural, clear 1 Corruption box.</li>
<li>For each session where your character takes significant action to suppress knowledge of the unnatural (burning books, destroying artifacts, killing witnesses), clear 1 Corruption box. (<em>Cthulhu Dark</em> inspired this option.)</li>
<li>(In the future I might adapt a Bonds mechanic from <em>Delta Green</em> here: something like damaging one bond will clear 1 Corruption box.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="important-personality-shifts-and-corruption-are-not-insanity.">Important: Personality shifts and corruption are not insanity.</h2>
<p>Instead they show how your character is responding to the disturbing but seductive power of the unnatural. Think of <em>corruption as becoming an anti-hero, or even a villain</em>, not as “going crazy.”</p>
