I love cosmic horror as a genre, but like other folks on this subreddit I've come to dislike CoC-style Sanity mechanics.  IMO at best they break the mood with cartoon antics (the PC temporarily thinks they're a chicken or something); more often they play off harmful stereotypes of mental illness.  I really like the way *Fate of Cthulhu* replaced this with a Corruption mechanic, representing the temptations of unnatural power and the way the unnatural gradually transforms a protagonist's personality: "It’s not a form of 'damage' that makes a character less viable or less of a protagonist. (It’s more of a resource that, when spent by the player, pushes the character towards transformation ....)"

# Connecting with the Unnatural (replaces Use Magic)

*Weird* represents the strength of your connection to the unnatural.  This connection can take many different forms:  studying esoteric books, innate psychic abilities, a spirit guide, fringe scientific research, (former?) cult membership, etc.  If you're playing a character with high Weird bonus, take a moment to think about what their connection to the unnatural is like.

Use Magic is not available.  The following basic moves take its place. 

## Spout Mythos ##
You can also draw on your knowledge and understanding of the unnatural to Investigate a Mystery.

* Roll +Weird instead of +Sharp; otherwise this is identical to Investigate a Mystery.
* Compared to the Sharp-based Investigate a Mystery, this move will tend to be more insightful, precise, or immediately useful concerning the unnatural aspects of the mystery.
* The Sharp-based move will tend to be more insightful, accurate, or immediately useful concerning the mundane aspects.

## Exploit the Unnatural ##  
When you draw on your connection to the unnatural to achieve an effect beyond ordinary human abilities, say what you're trying to achieve and how, and roll +Weird.  After resolving the effects of exploiting the unnatural, immediately Suffer Backlash.

* The effects, glitches, requirements, success, partial success, and miss conditions are identical to Use Magic.
* One additional potential glitch is taking -1 forward to the Suffer Backlash roll.

## Suffer Backlash ##
Exploiting your connection to the unnatural is physically and psychologically disturbing.  Roll +Weird. **You want to roll low.** 

* Weird is effectively a penalty, not a bonus.  The stronger your connection to the unnatural, the more susceptible you are to the backlash.
* A Hex's Rotes (and related moves, as with the Corruption benefit) and A Spooky's Big Whammy do not cause you to Suffer Backlash.
* On a 10+, choose 3 from the list of Backlash Effects.
* On a 7-9, choose 2.
* On a miss, choose 1.

## Backlash Effects ##

*  \-1 ongoing for all non-Weird rolls\*
*  \-Weird forward
*  You experience a personality shift (unusually aggressive, passive, fearful, short-sighted, etc.)\*
*  Check 1 Corruption
*  Take 1 Harm

\*: These effects are temporary, and are removed either by taking a short break from the action in relative peace and quiet *or* you or another character successfully Acts Under Pressure to talk you down.

## Advanced Exploit the Unnatural ##
All playbooks have the following advanced improvement available:

* **Advanced Exploit the Unnatural**:  When exploiting the unnatural, on a 12+ you do not Suffer Backlash.


## Corruption ##
Every character has 7 Corruption boxes, which start empty.  When you check the last box do all of the following:

* Permanently take +1 Weird and -1 any other attribute
   * If your character has +4 Weird, their days as a PC are numbered.  Talk to the Keeper about how the character's story will transition.
* Gain 1 rote (as per the Hex playbook)
* Undergo a permanent personality shift making you less reliable and trustworthy as a teammate, eg, more suspicious, secretive, unpredictable, more likely to act rashly, ignore advice and assistance from others, willing to sacrifice others for your own benefit, etc.
   * Explain to the Keeper what the personality shift will look like, so they can encourage you to roleplay that shift.
* Empty all 7 Corruption boxes.

## Clearing corruption ##
There are a few ways to clear Corruption boxes:

1. For each session where your character is active but does not Exploit the Unnatural, clear 1 Corruption box.
2. For each session where your character takes significant action to suppress knowledge of the unnatural (burning books, destroying artifacts, killing witnesses), clear 1 Corruption box. (*Cthulhu Dark* inspired this option.)
3. (In the future I might adapt a Bonds mechanic from *Delta Green* here: something like damaging one bond will clear 1 Corruption box.)


## Important:  Personality shifts and corruption are not insanity.## 
Instead they show how your character is responding to the disturbing but seductive power of the unnatural.  Think of *corruption as becoming an anti-hero, or even a villain*, not as "going crazy."
